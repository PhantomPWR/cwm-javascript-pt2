		<h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
		<h2>Objects</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>If a function is part of an object, it's called a method</li>
			<li>If an object has one or more methods, it has behavior</li>
			<li>Objects can have properties and methods</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Factory Functions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Factory functions are functions that return objects</li>
			<li>Factory functions are camelCase</li>
			<li>Factory functions are used to create multiple objects</li>
			<li>
				Factory functions are used to create objects with different
				values
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Constructor Functions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Constructor functions are used to create objects</li>
			<li>Constructor functions are PascalCase</li>
			<li>Constructor functions are used to create a single object</li>
			<li>
				Constructor functions are used to create objects with the same
				values
			</li>
			<li>
				Constructor functions are used to create objects with behavior
			</li>
			<li>No need to return an object in a constructor function</li>
			<li>
				If 'new' is omitted, 'this' will refer to the global/window
				object
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Value vs Reference Types</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Primitive types are copied by their value</li>
			<li>Reference types are copied by their reference</li>
			<li>Objects are reference types</li>
			<li>Objects are stored in memory</li>
			<li>Objects are copied by their reference</li>
			<li>Objects are mutable</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Abstraction</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Abstraction is hiding the details and showing the essentials
			</li>
			<li>Used to reduce complexity</li>
			<li>Used to manage complexity</li>
			<li>Reduces impact of change</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Private Properties & Methods</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Not accessible from outside</li>
			<li>Used to hide information</li>
			<li>Used to protect information</li>
			<li>Used to prevent bugs</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Scope & Closure</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				When you have a function inside another function, the inner
				function has access to the variables in the outer function. This
				is called closure.
			</li>
			<li>Scope is about where variables can be accessed</li>
			<li>
				Closures are about a function's ability to retain access to
				variables from its scope at creation time, even if that scope is
				no longer active
			</li>
		</ol>
